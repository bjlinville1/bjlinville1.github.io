				<h2>Skills</h2>
				<p>Most of my work has been within the Rails framework using Ruby, Javascript, HTML, HAML, ERB, AJAX, and CSS. I am very familiar with the JQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, Tablesorter, and FullCalendar libraries, as well as many gems, including Devise, Geocoder, Twillio, and Paperclip/Figaro. <br>
				I have used Heroku for deployment, RSpec (Capybara, FactoryGirl, etc) for testing, and Git for version control. <br>
				Smoulder is my most recent project that you can view. 
				<a class="github-link" href="http://smoulder.herokuapp.com/">Check it out</a> by logging in with randy@stamm.com as the username and password14 as the password.</p>

				<h2>Work history</h2>
				<p>I wouldn't trade my past 3 years for anything. I've traveled the world, married the love of my life, and witnessed the birth of my first son. I've had the great fortune to get to know my family as an adult. I've worked many jobs in many different industries;<!--  - sensor technician, airplane mechanic, life insurance salesman, welder, freelance database administration, quality control on a manufacturing line, high school basketball coach, car salesman, Ultimate frisbee league founder and director, building foundation repairman, church sports program director, roofer, the list goes on - --> enough to know exactly what I want out of my career, and what kind of company I want to contribute my time and resources to. I feel that I have been very blessed to be able to explore life during this time, and I will carry the lessons I have learned from it with me for the rest of my life.</p>
